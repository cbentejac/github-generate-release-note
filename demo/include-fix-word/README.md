# Demo

Release note generated with the word "[FIX]" included.

Cancelled pull requests like #9 are automatically ignored.

The pull request number is directly shown, and it is not necessary to hover over the link or to click it to see which pull request is referred to.

All the pull requests that contain the word "[FIX]" (not case-sensitive) in their title are included in the final release note, but in a dedicated subsection.

_Any file in this directory beside this README.md is a result of the command below._

./github-generate-release-note.py -o cbentejac -r github-generate-release-note -m "Demo Milestone" --pr-nb --word-include [FIX]
